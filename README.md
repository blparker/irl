### Setup
- Check out the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/blparker/irl.git`

- In the root directory, run:

`npm install`

- This will install dependencies. Next, open the XCode project (under ios directory). Can either double click
the project in Finder or type:

`open ios/irl.xcodeproj`

- Start the React native development server:

`npm start` (may need to do `sudo npm start`)

Run the simulator in XCode. Should load up React Native project.
